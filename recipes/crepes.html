        <h2>Dish Description</h2>
        <p>Crêpes are an easy and delicious dish that anyone can learn how to prepare. If you have a stove, you are practically good to go.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>500 ml milk</li>
            <li>100 ml cold water</li>
            <li>150 g coarse flour</li>
            <li>100 g fine flour</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
            <li><em>Optional: tablespoon of rum, vanilla extract</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack five eggs and whisk them. You can use electric mixer, but a fork does just fine.</li>
                <li>To the eggs add 500ml of milk and mix.</li>
                <li>Add a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Mix very well.</li>
                <li>To the egg and milk mixture add the flour. If you can, you can sift it into the mixture.</li>
                <em>When the flour and egg mixture is finely combined, you can add rum, vanilla extract or other spices to your liking.</em>
                <li>Lastly, add 100 ml of cold water and mix the mixture.</li>
                <li>Let the batter rest for half an hour.</li>
                <li>For cooking, put a teaspoon of oil (coconout or sunflower seed oil) on the pan and turn on the heat.</li>
                <li>When the pan is hot, add a ladle full of batter onto it.</li>
                <li>When you see the edges of the batter become brown, flip the pancakes and cook them for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process until the batter is gone.</li>
                <li>You can eat crêpes by themselves or spread jam on them.</li>
                <li>Bon appétit!</li>
            </ol>
