        <h2>Dish Description</h2>
        <p>Pumpkin soup is a hearty autumn meal you can prepare with ease.</p>
        <p>The only appliances you'll need are a stove and an immersion blender.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 butternut squash or hokkaido pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 leek</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>4 medium sized potatoes</li>
            <li>Spices: nutmeg, ginger and salt (you can add your own)</li>
            <li><em>Optional: sour cream</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the potatoes and wash other ingredients(vegetables).</li>
                <li>Cut the vegetables in small cubes.</li>
                <li>Cut the onions and garlic into small pieces.</li>
                <li>To the stove add a pot with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Let the oil heat up. Then add chopped onion and garlic. Occasionally stir.</li>
                <li>When the onion and garlic become a bit brown, add leek and stir occasionally. Cover the pot with a lid and let them simmer.</li>
                <li>After 3 to 5 minutes, add the cut up vegetables and spices.</li>
                <li>Let the vegetables cook for one hour. If they are sticking to the bottom of the pot, add a bit of water (cca. 100ml at a time).</li>
                <li>When the vegetables are fully cooked, let them cool down.</li>
                <li>When they are warm (not hot) to the touch, blend them with an immersion blender.</li>
                <em>Optional step: Heat up the pumpkin soup afterwards and add a tablespoon of sour cream per serving.</em>
                <li>Bon app√©tit!</li>
